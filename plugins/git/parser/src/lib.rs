//! A repository's history → graph facts, read straight out of `.git`.
//!
//! Every other drsg plugin reads *source*: a tree of files, as they are now.
//! This one reads the second source of truth sitting beside that tree — who
//! changed what, in what order, on which branch, and which of those commits
//! were later rewritten. None of it is visible to a walk of the working tree,
//! and all of it is exact: a commit's parents are not inferred, they are
//! written down.
//!
//! ## What it produces
//!
//! | Node | Key | What it is |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Commit` (also `Merge`) | `commit:<sha>` | one commit; `Merge` when it has two or more parents |
//! | `Branch` (also `Remote`) | `branch:<refname>` | a branch, local or remote-tracking |
//! | `Tag` | `tag:<refname>` | a tag, annotated or lightweight |
//! | `Rebase` | `rebase:<ref>@<time>` | one replay, reconstructed from the reflog |
//!
//! | Edge | Between | Says |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `PARENT` (`order`) | commit → commit | the whole merge structure: `order = 1` is the line the commit was made on, the rest is what a merge brought in |
//! | `TIP` | branch → commit | where the branch points |
//! | `TAGS` | tag → commit | what the tag names |
//! | `ONTO` | rebase → commit | what the replay was based on |
//! | `REPLACED` | rebase → commit | the tip it rewrote away |
//! | `PRODUCED` (`step`, `kind`) | rebase → commit | each commit it wrote |
//! | `RESULT` | rebase → commit | the tip the branch ended on |
//! | `ON` | rebase → branch | the branch it ran on |
//!
//! ## The one thing that cannot be exact
//!
//! **Rebases are not in the commit graph at all.** A rebase writes new commits
//! and moves a ref; nothing in any object records that one commit replaced
//! another. The only record is the reflog, which is local to a single clone
//! and expires — so a rebase older than `gc.reflogExpire` (90 days by default)
//! left no trace anywhere. Everything under `Rebase` is qualified by that, and
//! it is said in the report rather than left for a reader to discover.
//!
//! The reflog is also why commits no branch can reach are kept: the commits a
//! rebase abandoned are still in the object store, and a graph showing the
//! rewritten branch without what it replaced would answer "what did this
//! rebase change?" with silence. Those commits carry `reachable: false`.
