# Build the Go plugin. `-scheduler=none` because a component exports calls
# rather than running a program — and TinyGo's scheduler runs between a
# wasmexport's return and the host reading the result, where its GC can col-
# lect the very buffer being returned. `-gc=leaking` because the conservative
# collector still trapped under wasmexport; the host runs every call in a
# fresh store, so what leaks dies with the call and the store's memory limit
# is the bound.
#
# `wasip2-deep-stack.json` for the stack, because go/parser and go/printer
# recurse over the shape of what they read and this stack is not the host's
# to grow: it is fixed when the plugin is linked, sits at the bottom of
# linear memory (`--stack-first`), and has no guard page under it — so
# exhausting it walks the stack pointer past zero, wraps, and faults as an
# out-of-bounds access that never says "stack". `Config::max_wasm_stack` is a
# different stack and does nothing here. At the 64 KiB default a nested
# composite literal traps between 120 and 160 levels deep, measured; 1 MiB
# buys about sixteen times that, for fifteen more pages of a store whose
# limit is gigabytes.
#
# It has to be a target file. TinyGo's own `-stack-size` is the *goroutine*
# stack — under `-scheduler=none` there are no goroutines and it changes
# nothing, verified: the build accepts `-stack-size=1MB` and still emits
# `__stack_pointer = 65536`. What sets the wasm stack is wasm-ld's
# `-z stack-size`, which TinyGo never passes, so the target adds it.
#
# Hence the assertion, which is how that was caught and is how the next
# silent revert will be. wasm-tools is already a build dependency — TinyGo's
# wasip2 target shells out to it to lift the module into a component.
#
# Build the Go plugin: no scheduler, leaking GC, and a 1 MiB guest stack.
